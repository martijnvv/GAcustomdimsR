# GA custom dimension export to Excel with R
Using the googleanalyticsR package, I pull all the data from a Google Analytics view.
It exports all the data in a summarised tab, and each custom dimension is also exported to each own Excel tab.

## Usecases

This has been helpful to me for several usecase:
* Validation of dataquality
* startingpoint of basic analysis and/or reporting
